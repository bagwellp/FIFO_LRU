# FIFO_LRU
This program was written in response to the assignment outlined below. 

Paging algorithms: 

Write a program that takes in the following parameters: Size of program, size of main memory, a sequence of requests for program words. 

Assume that the page frame size will match the page size. Your program should evaluate the hit ratio according to the LRU and FIFO algorithms. Use the following sample data.

Program size: 460 words
Main memory size: 200 words
Page size: 100 words
Program word requests: [10, 11, 104, 170, 73, 309, 185, 246, 434, 458, 364]

Compare the performance (hit ratio) of the algorithms (FIFO and LRU) with a page size of 200 words and 400 words. Factor in the transfer times as well. Assume that transferring a 100-word page takes 1 sec, transferring a 200-word page takes 2 seconds and transferring a 400-word page takes 5 seconds.
